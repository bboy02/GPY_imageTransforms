GPU-Accelerated Data Augmentation for Computer Vision:
This project demonstrates how to leverage GPU acceleration to implement real-time data augmentation for computer vision tasks using PyTorch and CUDA. The augmentation techniques include rotation, flipping, scaling, and color jittering, which can significantly speed up the image preprocessing pipeline when training deep learning models.


Overview:
Data augmentation is a common technique used to artificially increase the size of a dataset by applying random transformations to the images. This project utilizes GPU acceleration for real-time data augmentation, reducing the time required for image preprocessing and improving the overall training performance for large-scale datasets.



Augmentation Techniques:
Random Rotation: Rotates images by a random angle.

Random Horizontal Flip: Randomly flips the images horizontally.

Random Resized Crop: Randomly crops and resizes the image.

Color Jitter: Randomly alters the brightness, contrast, saturation, and hue of the image.

The GPU acceleration ensures that these operations are done efficiently, especially with large datasets, enabling faster iteration during model training.
